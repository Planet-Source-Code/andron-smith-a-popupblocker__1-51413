### Description

Ok. I've worked on the popup blocker, and this is the second edition of the first 1. If you all liked the first one. I think you all will find this one a bit more amusing. Thanks for all of yours votes. Please do keep on voting.
 
### More Info
 
You must have a version of Internet Explore Installed on your system. As this program will be relying on that.
